# Module_3_Challenge

In this challenge, I have explored potential arbitrage opportunities from January 2018 - March 2018.

First, we collected the CSV data.

Next, we cleaned up the data to make it easier to work with. This includes removing missing/duplicate data to make it more compatible for our analysis.

Lastly, we utilized statistical analysis to better understand the data, as well as visualization in the form of graphs/charts.
