# Module_3_Challenge

In this challenge, I have explored potential bitcoin arbitrage opportunities from January 2018 - March 2018. We used data from two cryptocurrency exchange platforms: Coinbase and Bitstamp.

First, we collected the CSV data.

Next, we cleaned up the data to make it easier to work with. This includes removing missing/duplicate data to make it more compatible for our analysis.

Lastly, we utilized statistical analysis to better understand the data, as well as visualization of the data in the form of graphs/charts.

The result of this challenge shows us how much one could have secured arbitrage profits on the cryptocurrency market during Q1 2018.
